# Read about the usethis package
usethis::use_usethis()

# open the .Rprofile and add the one liner generated by above code which is already copied to the clipboard and save the .Rprofile. This is to load usethis when we start R so we dont have to say usethis::use_package("readr") each time and instead we can just write use_package like below

#Restart the R using palette

 source("~/.Rprofile")
 
# Add the usethis package as a workflow dependancy
  use_package("usethis", "suggests")
 
#Workflow dependency: suggets
#Build dependancy: Imports
#“imports” corresponds to build dependencies, while “suggests” are equivalent to what we call workflow dependencies.

#Connect to Github

#Add the gitcreds package as a workflow dependency. 
use_package("gitcreds", "suggests")

usethis::use_github()
